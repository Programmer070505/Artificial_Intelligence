This uses the basic concepts of minimax. 
The code's structure has been written down for you. 
Some places have been left blank for you "TODO". 
The AI is composed of two python codes: runner.py, and tictactoe.py. 
"Runner.py" will run the visual parts, this code has been completed for you. 
The "tictactoe.py" will contain the minimax algorithm. 
Give the code a try and I hope this code acts as a good practice plan. Enjoy!

Prerequisites: Knowing the Minimax technique and having a strong basis in OOP with python.
